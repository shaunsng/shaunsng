## Other Interests
While my professional experience has been in non-technical areas - government strategy and policy, I have been "casual techie" and dabbler of technology since a young age - and think fondly of playing games on MS-DOS and simple building of PCs in the 2000s. I have broad intesest and enjoy learning new skills and knowledge in history, art, anime and Japanese culture. 

This portfolio is a work-in-progress. Thank you.
